Players can compete against themselves and others to beat their best itme for finishing the game.

# How to Play
You will be deat 5 sets of cards with the top card in each deck face up. The open car at the top of the screen will change every few seconds. To play a card tap one of the open cards in your hand. You can play cards with the same number of objects, same color, or same shape as the open card. 
If you play an invalid card that doesn't match the opn card there will be a deduction to your score. So you must be quick, but accurate!
