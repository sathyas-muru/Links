# How to Play
You will be deat 5 sets of cards with the top card in each deck face up. The open car at the top of the screen will change every few seconds. To play a card tap one of the open cards in your hand. You can play cards with the same number of objects, the same color, or the same shape as the open card. 
If you play an invalid card that doesn't match the open card there will be a deduction to your score. So you must be quick, but accurate!

Links is available on the Play Store but it is in the closed testing phase. Therefore, of you would like to play the game, please reach out to me directly so I can send you a personal link.
